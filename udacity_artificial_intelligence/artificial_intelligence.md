# Artificial Intelligence - Udacity

## Lesson 1: Welcome to AI

### 1.2 Quiz: Course Overview

Q: An AI program is called?
  
* Wetware
* Formula
* **(Intelligent Agent)**

### 1.3 Quiz: Intelligent Agents

#### Intelligent Agents

* Agent interacts with an environment.
* Reads its environment with sensors.
* Interacts with its environment with actuators.
* The loop of environment, feedback through sensors, agent decision, and actuator interaction with environment is the **Perception Action Cycle.**

Q: AI has successfully been used in?
* **(Finance)**
* **(Robotics)**
* **(Games)**
* **(Medicine)**
* **(The Web)**
* None of them

### 1.4 Applications of AI

#### AI in Finance

* Agent: Trading Agent
* Environment: Stock Market, etc
* Decisions: Buy or sell

#### AI in Robotics

* Agent: Many
* Sensors: cameras, microphones, touch, etc
* Actuators: motors, voice, etc
* Environment: Physical environments

#### AI in Games

* Agent: Game Agent
* Environment: You if game plays against you (adversarial games)
* Sensors: your moves
* Actuators: Its own moves

#### AI in Medicine

* Agent: Diagnostic Agent
* Environment: You, Doctor
* Sensors: Vitals, signals,
* Actuators: Diagnostics

#### AI on the Web

* Agent: Crawler Agent
* Environment: World Wide Web
* Sensors: Web Pages
* Actuators: Search Results

### 1.5-7 Quiz: Terminology

* **Fully** vs **Partially Observable**
  * Fully - Can see the entire state of the environment (Chess)
  * Partially - Can only see part of the state of the environment (Card game)
* **Deterministic** vs **Stochastic**
  * Deterministic - Outcome of actions are unique 
  * Stochastic - Outcome of action is not predictable
* **Discrete** vs **Continuous**
  * Discrete - Finite number of things that can be done
  * Continuous - Infinite number of things that can be done
* **Benign** vs **Adversarial**
  * Benign - Not out to get you (weather)
  * Adversarial - Out to get you (games)

Q:

|           | Partially Observable | Stochastic | Continuous | Adversarial |
| ---       | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Checkers  | | | | x |
| Poker     | x | x | | x |
| Robotic Car | x | x | x | |

### 1.8 AI and Uncertainty

* AI is Uncertainty Management
* AI is the discipline applied when you want to know what to do when you don't know what to do.
* Reasons for Uncertainty
  * Sensor Limits
  * Adversaries
  * Stochastic Environments
  * Laziness
  * Ignorance
